data_split:
# - test_size: 
#     The size of the test set, default is 0.1, the size of the validation set is set to be the same as the test set.
#     If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. 
#     If int, represents the absolute number of test samples.
# - shuffle: whether to shuffle the data before splitting, if shuffle=False then stratify must be None
# - stratify: 
#     If not None, data is split in a stratified fashion, using this as the class labels. 
#     Recommended for imbalanced datasets or in case of multi-label classification.
